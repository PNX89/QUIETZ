    TWO DEFECTS, BOTH LATENT RATHER THAN LIVE. The published range is correct today and was
    produced by a function that cannot be relied on to keep it correct.

    First, it matched every quoted `x.y` anywhere in the workflow, not the Python matrix. A
    quoted action version or a timeout would have landed on the published card. This repository's
    sibling generator already carries the lesson, that a list has to be read as structure and
    never as text that looks like structure, and it had not been carried here.

    Second, and worse, it ordered with `float`. `float("3.9")` is 3.9 and `float("3.13")` is
    3.13, so the moment a 3.9 leg existed the card would have published a range running
    backwards. Versions are tuples of integers, not decimals.

    A job allowed to fail is also skipped now. An advisory leg is a good thing to run and a
    dishonest thing to advertise, which is the defect this same function had in QUOTEZ, where it
    published 3.14 support the build would not fail over.
